Thank you for sharing this. I wondered how big the impact of this vulnerability is when you have only the ability to
access runs via the Kubernetes API? Would you argue that the vulnerability becomes harder (or impossible?) to exploit
when you can only interact with the service via another API?

In my current understanding of the vulnerabilities, it seems like you need to be able to interact with runs directly.

Furthermore, the ability to “replace” /dev/null seems rather only possible when conducted by a user with higher
permissions?

Lastly, I do not see a container break when /proc/sysrq-trigger is not enabled. I am not sure if there are other ways,
there will be, but I am not seeing this exploitable in most environments.

Thank you, great work!

So far,

Hello,

This is a notification to vendors that use or ship runc about THREE (3)
high-severity vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-31133, CVE-2025-52565, and
CVE-2025-52881). All three vulnerabilities ultimately allow (through
different methods) for full container breakouts by bypassing runc's
restrictions for writing to arbitrary /proc files.

Today we have released the following runc releases which include more
than 20 patches to resolve this issue:

* runc v1.4.0-rc.3 <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc.3>
* runc v1.3.3 <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.3.3>
* runc v1.2.8 <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.2.8>

We strongly recommend you update as soon as possible. For your own
reference I have attached a tarball of the patches (which apply cleanly
on top of runc v1.2.7, v1.3.2 and v1.4.0-rc.2).

Unfortunately the patches are are quite large as they required a lot of
development work in github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin along with
quite deep changes to runc. I would recommend just going with the
released versions.

Note that these patches have not been split into per-CVE patches, as the
resolutions for each issue overlap and so some patches help resolve more
than one CVE on the list. We strongly recommend simply applying all of
the provided patches (we have included a squashed single-patch version
for your convenience -- see v1.[234].patch).

| **NOTE**:
| Some vendors were given a pre-release version of this release.
| These public releases include two extra patches to fix regressions
| dIscovered very late during the embargo period and were thus not
| included in the pre-release versions. Please update to this version.
| The above tarball includes these extra patches as well.

/*** Vulnerabilities ***/

Below is a break-down of the key points of each issue. Once this
vulnerability is made public on the embargo date, the linked advisory
pages will contain some more information about the issues.

Please note that while these issues are generally related, the available
mitigations (if any) vary from issue to issue. However, all of these
attacks rely on starting containers with custom mount configurations --
if you do not run untrusted container images from unknown or unverified
sources then these attacks would not be possible to exploit. Note that
Dockerfiles support custom mount configurations (with RUN --mount=...)
and so these issues are also exploitable from Dockerfiles.

Also please note that the below CVSS scores are based on the threat
model from *runc's point of view*. If you were to analyse the same
vulnerability from the perspective of network-enabled systems like
Docker or Kubernetes you would likely end up with a much higher
severity.

/* CVE-2025-31133 */

"container escape via 'masked path' abuse due to mount race conditions"

CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H (7.3)

<https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2>

CVE-2025-31133 exploits an issue with how masked paths are implemented
in runc. When masking files, runc will bind-mount the container's
/dev/null inode on top of the file. However, if an attacker can replace
/dev/null with a symlink to some other procfs file, runc will instead
bind-mount the symlink target read-write. This issue affects all known
runc versions.

This stage happens after pivot_root(2) and so cannot be used to
bind-mount host files directly. However, paths like
/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern which can be used to break out of a
container entirely (coredump helpers are spawned as upcalls, which are
not namespaced and have full host privileges). /proc/sysrq-trigger can
also be used by an attacker to cause the host system to crash or halt.
(This is "Attack 1".)

While developing a fix for this issue, we also discovered that if the
attacker instead deleted /dev/null, runc would purposefully ignore the
error and thus make maskedPath a no-op. This is slightly less serious,
but it would permit some information disclosure through masked files
like /proc/kcore and /proc/timer_list. (This is "Attack 2".)

Potential mitigations for this issue include:

* Using user namespaces, with the host root user not mapped into the
   container's namespace. procfs file permissions are managed using Unix
   DAC and thus user namespaces stop a container process from being able
   to write to them.

* Not running as a root user in the container (this includes disabling
   setuid binaries with noNewPrivileges). As above, procfs file
   permissions are managed using Unix DAC and thus non-root users cannot
   write to them.

* Depending on the maskedPath configuration (the default configuration
   only masks paths in /proc and /sys), using an AppArmor that blocks
   unexpected writes to any maskedPaths (as is the case with the default
   profile used by Docker and Podman) will block attempts to exploit
   this issue. However, CVE-2025-52881 allows an attacker to bypass LSM
   labels, and so this mitigation is not helpful when considered in
   combination with CVE-2025-52881.

* Based on our analysis, SELinux will NOT help mitigate this issue --
   the /dev/null bind-mount used for maskedPaths get re-labeled to the
   container context and thus the container will have access to them.

Thanks to Lei Wang (@ssst0n3 from Huawei) for finding and reporting the
original vulnerability (Attack 1), and Li Fubang (@lifubang from
acmcoder.com, CIIC) for discovering another attack vector (Attack 2)
based on @ssst0n3's initial findings.
